JavaScript Fundamentals

Coderslang: Become A Software Engineer (3 ratings)

JavaScript is the most popular language in the world. It's everywhere. From web pages in your browser to a mobile phone in your pocket and huge data centers all over the world, JS is the language that powers the Internet.

It's also one of the easiest programming languages in the world, which makes it a great first language for beginners.

I've built JavaScript Fundamentals as a programming course designed to give you hands-on experience with JS not by watching endless tutorials, but by coding. You'll start with the classic "Hello, world!" program and progress towards more advanced concepts like variables, types, conditional statements, loops, arrays, objects, and exception handling.

Building a solid foundation of JavaScript is a prerequisite to learning frameworks and ecosystems like React, Angular, Vue.js and Node.js.
